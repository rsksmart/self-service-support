    "question": "Why can't I choose the address?",
    "answer": "Currently it uses the token bridge always sends tokens to the same address on the other blockchain network, and so the sender and the receiver will always have the same address.\nYou will have the option to send to another address in the next version."

    "answer": "Decentralised apps on websites, such as the RSK Token Bridge,\ninteract with the blockchain network through a standard interface\nknown as a **web3 provider**.\nEach browser wallet attempts to \"inject\" a web3 provider as soon as it is loaded.\nThis means that if you have multiple browser extensions doing the same thing,\none of them will override the other(s).\n\nIn order to avoid this problem, and if you already have multiple wallets installed,\nis to choose which wallet you wish to use, and disable the other ones.\nTo do this in in Chrome, enter `chrome://extensions/` in your address bar,\nwhich brings you to a settings screen that lists all of\nthe browser extensions that you have installed.\nClick on the toggle button to disable all of the browser extensions\nthat inject **web3 providers**, except for the one that you wish to use.\nAfter this go to the RSK token bridge again, and refresh."
