    "answer": "24 hours is an approximation, it is not exact.\nWait until `5760` blocks have been confirmed since the transaction block number, plus 5 minutes.\nYour transaction `${txHash}` currently has only waited for `${txAge}` blocks."

  "address-choice": {
    "question": "Why can't I choose the address?",
    "answer": "Currently it uses the token bridge always sends tokens to the same address on the other blockchain network, and so the sender and the receiver will always have the same address.\nYou will have the option to send to another address in the next version."

    "question": "I don't see my transaction on the Token Bridge list",
    "answer": "The list is stored in local cache, so it's not shared across devices, and its erased if you clear your browser cookies and temporary files.\nYou can be sure than if the transaction is mined the tokens will cross no matter what the list says.\nIf this is not the reason why it is not there please let us know in the *#tokenbridge* channel on RSK Open slack (go to [developers.rsk.co/slack](https://developers.rsk.co/slack/) to join)."
